# Content Syndication

A plugin for syndicating content around our network of sites

## Features

* Embed content remotely via an embed tag
* Enable embedding of other sites also running this plugin (enqueing scripts and FL Builder support)

* The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.
* WP Plugin Scaffolding uses a strict file organization scheme that corresponds both to the PSR-4 autoloading scheme, and that makes it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
* The project used composer to manage autoloading, and gulp + webpack to compile scss and javascript

## Installation

1) Install [Github Plugin Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)
2) Go to setting => github updater, and follow the instructions to install from this repository

## ToDo

This is a living project, so expect updates.

Features still to be added:

* A widget for easy embedding in widget areas
* RSS / Rest API sharing of content between sites - This feature will need to address several issues to be viable.
